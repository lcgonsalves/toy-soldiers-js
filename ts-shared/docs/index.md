# TSShared (Toy Soldiers Shared Module)
This module encompasses the shared components and concepts
used by the [`ts-game`](/ts-game/docs/index.md) and [`ts-server`](/ts-server/docs/index.md) modules.
It is responsible for implementing all game mechanics and other abstractions needed to
make the game work properly.
