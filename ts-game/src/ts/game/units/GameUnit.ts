/**
 * @author LÃ©o Gonsalves
 *
 * Describes an individual, physical, abstract game unit. Game units are the building blocks of Toy Soldiers. These are
 * used to represent, on the board, locations, players, paths, and others. They describe interfaces for the most basic
 * interactions between units, as well as instantiation in the Game Map and transformations within the grid.
 *
 * How to use:
 *
 * Extend this class and implement the abstract methods:
 *  - renderDepiction -> append elements to the existing groups
 *  - updateDepiction -> update attr's according to datum
 *  - removeDepiction -> remove appended elements
 *
 * Order of rendering can be manipulated by passing a custom "preprocess(s: Selection): void" function
 * to the constructor, where you can append other groups in the order that you'd like.
 *
 * After instantiating the extended class, you must manually call "render()" to append
 * the svg elements for the first time.
 *
 * If the contents of the AssociatedDatum change, you must call "refresh()" to update
 * the attributes of the associated elements according to your implementation.
 *
 * If the GameUnit is removed, call "remove()"
 *
